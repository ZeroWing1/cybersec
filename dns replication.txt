DNS Replication
	Process of updating DNS records on different servers so they contain
	the same data

Zone Transfer
	- Transfer of DNS records between DNS servers
	- between domain controllers (active directory integrated)
	- between primary and secondary zones
	- between secondary zones and other secondary zones
	- between active directory integrated and secondary zones

Zone Replication
	- Active directory integrated zones replicate with AD
		- Runs on same schedule as AD
		- If you replicate AD, so does DNS replication
		- If AD fails or stops, check the event view for AD errors
		- Good for recovery as DNS is simply installed on a domain controller
			(DC)
		- Primary and secondary zones
			- Set security who can replicate the data
			- Zone replication can be triggered by:
				Refresh interval expires
				The server holding the secondary DNS zone boots up
				Primary zone can notify the secondary zone a change has occured
