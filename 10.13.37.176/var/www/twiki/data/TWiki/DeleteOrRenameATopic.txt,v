---++ FAQ:

How do I delete or rename a topic?

---++ Answer:

New to the 01-Sep-2001 version of TWiki, you can rename, move and delete topics directly from your browser (previously, these operations could only be done manually, by someone with file-level access to the Web server). 

Moving lets you transfer a topic from one web to another. The soft delete moves a topic to the special ==Trash== web, where it's hidden but can be "undeleted" with system administrator access. 

Click ==[More]== on the control bar at the bottom of the page you want to change, then choose ==[Rename/move]==, and make your changes that screen. There's a link that launches to the ManagingTopics reference page in a pop-up window.

__NOTE:__ The configuration of your site and your own access permissions determine whether you can access these functions.

ManagingTopics can also be used to delete a topic.  This is done by moving the topic to the Trash Web.	If this Web does not exist ask your %WIKIWEBMASTER% to add it.
