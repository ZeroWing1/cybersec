---# Managing Webs

_Adding webs is a web based operation; renaming and deleting webs are manual operations done directly on the server_

---++ Overview

A TWikiSite is divided into webs; each one represents one subject, one area of collaboration. Administrators can add/rename/delete webs.

#WebTemplate
---++ Choose Web Template

There are two methods used to create a new web.  First you can use a specially designed TemplateWeb.  This is an invisible web that begins with an underscore &quot;_&quot; character.  All topics in the _default template web will be copied into your new web.

The second method is to use an existing web as a template web.  This may be useful if you already have a web that you like to use as a starting point.  Only topics that have names beginning with *Web...* (like "%HOMETOPIC%", "%NOTIFYTOPIC%", etc.) are copied.

In either case you will want to be sure to verify that your new web has all the custom modifications that you desire.

#CreateNewWeb
---++ Adding a New Web

<form name="admin" action="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/manage%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%INTURLENCODE{"%WEB%/%TOPIC%"}%" method="post">
Create a new web by filling out this form. __Note:__ It is not recommended to create a new web for each little project. You can organize content within a web using TWikiForms and FormattedSearch. Cross-linking topics and search is easier if there are only a few larger webs.
|  *Name of new web:* | <input name="newweb" type="text" value="%URLPARAM{"newweb"}%" size="16" /> | Enter a short name of up to 10 characters. The name must start with one or more upper case letters, followed by optional lower case letters or numbers; it cannot be a %TWIKIWEB%.WikiWord |
|  *Based on web:* | <select name="baseweb"> %WEBLIST{ "<option>$name</option>" webs="webtemplate,public" selection="_default" separator=" "}% </select> | Select a TemplateWeb |
|  *Web color:* | <input name="webbgcolor" type="text" value="#D0D0D0" size="16" /> | Enter a StandardColors code for the web |
|  *Description:<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;* | <input type="text" name="sitemapwhat" value="" size="60" /><br /> Enter a short description of the web. Write =Web.TopicName= instead of just =TopicName= if you include links. This will list the web in the %TWIKIWEB%.SiteMap (leave field empty if you prefer not to update the directory.) ||
|  *Use to...<br /> &nbsp;* | <input type="text" name="sitemapuseto" value="...collaborate on" size="60" /><br /> Continue the sentence describing the intended use. This is also for the %TWIKIWEB%.SiteMap ||
|  *Exclude web from "search all":* | <input type="radio" name="nosearchall" value="" checked="checked" /> No &nbsp; <input type="radio" name="nosearchall" value="on" /> Yes | Specify if you want to exclude the web from a "search all webs" search. Note that the %TWIKIWEB%.SiteMap will not list the web if you select Yes. |
| | <input type="submit" value="Create new web" /> ||
<input name="newtopic" type="hidden" value="%URLPARAM{"newtopic"}%" />
<input name="action" type="hidden" value="createweb" />
</form>

*Note:* Attachments will NOT get copied over along with their topics.  This will be a feature added for the TWiki:Codev/CairoRelease.

*Note:* This script does not yet edit the [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPreferences]] file to update the =WIKIWEBLIST=.  This must be done by hand.

The manage script while creating the new web will update the following variables in the WebPreferences: =WEBBGCOLOR=, =SITEMAPLIST=, =SITEMAPWHAT=, =SITEMAPUSETO= and =NOSEARCHALL=.  These variables are now used to dynamically generate the SiteMap.

---++ Renaming or Deleting a Web

Renaming or deleting a web requires direct access to the installation files on the host server. There are currently no browser-based equivalents of the Rename/move/delete topic tools for working with webs.

*NOTE:* If you plan to rename the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, remember that TWiki stores user and group topics in =%<nop>MAINWEB%=, default named =Main=. That means, every WikiName signature - =Main.<nop>SomeUserName= - points to it and would need updating (unless the variable, =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeUserName=, is used throughout).
	1. Prepare your site: Search each web for links to the target web, searching topic text for =Oldwebname.=, including the dot so you'll find references like =Oldwebname.SomeTopic=. 
		* Make changes as required, to =Newwebname.SomeTopic= or better yet, to =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeTopic=.
	1. Edit the %WIKIPREFSTOPIC% topic: Rename or delete the web from the =WIKIWEBLIST= variable.
	1. Login to the %WIKITOOLNAME% server, via Telnet or FTP.
	1. Go to =twiki/data= and rename or remove the web directory.
	1. Go to =twiki/templates= and rename or remove the web directory if present.
	1. Go to =twiki/pub= and rename or remove the web directory if present.

To work with entire TWiki webs, you need direct access to the installation files on the host server. Connecting by Telnet or FTP is the usual approach. There are no browser-based web management tools. You can prepare a web for changes through browser-based individual topics by browser (see [[TWiki.ManagingTopics][ModifyTopics]]).

The current implementation of %WIKITOOLNAME% is designed to never forget.  So you can't delete a topic, however you can move or rename a topic and the original information is saved in topic meta data.  If you want an even stronger memory, you can disable renaming on some or all topics; see TWikiAccessControl.

	* It is advisable not to rename the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web.
	* Be aware that other webs might link to the web you want to rename / delete. Search each web for links to this web, i.e. search all webs for =Obsolete.= (include the period, this is to find topics like =Obsolete.SomeTopic= ). Take measures if necessary.
	* Edit the %WIKIPREFSTOPIC% topic and rename / delete the web from the =WIKIWEBLIST= variable.
	* Edit the TWikiWebsTable topic and rename / delete the web from the table.
	* Telnet to the %WIKITOOLNAME% installation.
	* cd to ==twiki/data== and rename / delete the web directory.
	* cd to ==twiki/templates== and rename / delete the web directory if present.
	* cd to ==twiki/pub== and rename / delete the web directory if present.

The current implementation of %WIKITOOLNAME% is designed to never forget, that means all topic changes are under revision control and you can't delete or rename topics. 

Nevertheless there are cases where you wish to delete topics. %WIKITOOLNAME% requires administrative stuff like that to be done on the shell level, so please ask your %WIKITOOLNAME% administrator to do that for you. A future version will allow administrators to do that on the browser level.

---+++ How to Rename or Delete a Topic

	* Go to the topic you want to rename / delete.
	* Find out the back-links to this page from _Ref-By_ . Modify other topics if needed.
	* Telnet to the %WIKITOOLNAME% installation.
	* cd to ==twiki/data== and then to the web where the topic is located. Rename / delete the topic ( ==name.txt== ) and repository file ( ==name.txt,v== ). __Hint:__ Instead of deleting a topic you could create a ==Trash== web and move topics/repositories to this web. (A future version of TWiki might have a Trash web.)
	* Edit the ==.changes== file and rename / delete all occurrences of the topic. __Note:__ There might be several lines of the topic.
	* cd to ==twiki/pub== and then to the web where the topic is located. Rename / delete the topic attachment directory if present.

The current implementation of TWiki is designed to never forget, that means all topic changes are under revision control and you can't delete or rename topics.

Nevertheless there are cases where you wish to delete topics. TWiki requires administrative stuff like that to be done on the shell level, so please ask your TWiki administrator to do that for you. A future version will allow administrators to do that on the browser level.

	* Find out the back-links to this page from _Ref-By_ . Modify other topics if needed. __Note:__ _Ref-By_ only finds topics in the current web. Search also in other webs if needed.
	* Telnet to the TWiki installation.

	* It is advisable not to rename the TWiki.Main web.
	* Be aware that other webs might link to the web you want to rename / delete. Search each web for links to this web, i.e. in each web search for =Obsolete.= (including the period, this is to find topics like =Obsolete.SomeTopic= ). Take measures if necessary.
