---+ <nop />GoodStyle Collaboration Tips

	* TWiki has a very simple *[[TWikiShorthand][text formatting shorthand]]*. In any case, you won't go wrong if you simply:
		* start each line without spaces
		* separate paragraphs with a blank line 

	* Run together capitalized words to form *[[WikiWords][WikiWords]]:* 
		* WikiWords automatically appear as hyperlinks
		* make up meaningful, reasonably brief Wiki names - it can be a challenge (it'll sharpen you up!)
		* WikiWords has name-creation tips that may help

	* If a *discussion* is going on:
		* separate each follow-up with a space
		* add your WikiName and the date at the end
		* OR, by all means, insert your comment where it seems to fit best:
			* you may want to inset it with a bullet and/or _set it in italics_ so it's clear (always sign and date)
		* if a sub-topic develops, separate it with a horizontal rule at beginning and end

	* A good format for a *new topic* is "dissertation followed by discussion": 
		* start with a brief, factual introduction, followed by double horizontal rules
		* let the discussion begin

	* When a discussion dies down and the page becomes static, if you're clear on your course, feel free to *refactor mercilessly*:
		* fearlessly edit down to capture the key points
		* reduce the noise without losing the facts or the flavor
		* if you merge or delete comments, group credit =Contributors:= at the end of the page
		* _This is how Wiki content matures and grows in value over time._

	* For *external site links*, you can type URLs directly into the text - =http://etcete.ra/...= - it'll clear to anyone where they're headed on click. 

	* TWiki is intended for world-wide use, and an international *standard date format* like 01 Sep 2001 is preferred. It's universally understood, and clearer than the xx/xx/xx format, where a date like 9/1/01 can mean either Jan or Sep, depending on the local conventions of the readers. For months, use the first three letters: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr,...

	* *TIP:* Check the source when you want to find out how something is formatted: click ==Edit== on the lower toolbar. To see earlier versions, click ==More==, then check ==Raw text format== and click ==View revision==. A bit of HTML experience can't hurt, but you'll soon see with TWikiShorthand how far that is from necessary.

TWiki has very simple TextFormattingRules. You won't go wrong if you start each line without spaces and separate paragraphs with a blank line. Run capitalized words together to make WikiWords, which
become hyperlinks. This sometimes requires creativity; you're up to it. WikiWords tells you how to create good topic names.

If a discussion is going on on a WikiTopic, separate each follow up with a separator. It is style to add your WikiName and date at the end.

A good format for a new topic is "dissertation followed by discussion": a factual introduction followed by opinions. After a while, the discussion will die down and the page will become static. At that point, feel free to "refactor mercilessly" to capture the key points whilst reducing the noise; this is how wiki content matures with time.

If you summarise an old discussion and merge or delete individual contributions, you can add the word "Contributors:" to the bottom of the page, and list the contributors there. 

If you want to link to external sites: Just type hyperlinks directly into the text - that makes it clear to readers whether they're browsing within %WIKITOOLNAME% or leaving it. It is usually better *not* to use the HTML tag =&lt;A HREF="..."&gt;= . 

Date format: %WIKITOOLNAME% is international, so the ISO date format like "06 Feb 1998" is preferred to one like "2/6/98", which can mean either February or June to different readers. For the month use Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov or Dec.

Feel free to look at the source to an existing page (click =Raw text=) if you want to see how something is formatted. A bit of HTML experience can't hurt, but is far from necessary.
