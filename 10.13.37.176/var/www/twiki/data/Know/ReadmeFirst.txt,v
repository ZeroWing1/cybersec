If you are not familiar with the %WIKITOOLNAME% collaboration tool, please visit %TWIKIWEB%.WelcomeGuest in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%TWIKIWEB% web first. 

*Note:* The %WIKITOOLNAME%.Know web is for demonstration purposes only. It hardly contains any data, its purpose is to show how %WIKITOOLNAME% can be used as a knowledge base for support (e.g. as a web based help desk application).

The %WIKITOOLNAME%.Know knowledge base has the following functions:

	1. *Submit Data to the Knowledge Base:* Enter data that could be useful for other support staff.
	2. *Search the Knowledge Base:* Search for a solution of a problem a customer has.
	3. *Email Notification:* Subscribe in %NOTIFYTOPIC% to get notified by email whenever the knowledge base gets updated.

*Submit Data to the Knowledge Base*

Please feel free to add any information you think can help the support staff solving problems. To contribute to the knowledge base, please create a new topic that contains a problem and solution (or workaround) pair.

To submit data to the Knowledge Base:
	* Think of a good topic name. It is recommended to use a name that describes the problem, e.g. an error message. The topic name should comply to the %TWIKIWEB%.WikiNotation. An sample topic name for the error message _Incorrect DLL version W32PTH10.DLL_ would be IncorrectDllVersionW32PTH10DLL.
	* The easiest way to create a new topic is to type in a new topic name into the edit field at the top of each page, press Enter and then click on the *Create* link at the bottom of the page.
	* Edit the new topic or copy & paste the text you already have.
	* Select the appropriate items in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.Know form. See WebForm for details. This allows detailed search in WebSearch later on.
	* [Preview Changes] and [Save Changes] when you are done.

*Search the Knowledge Base*

Please use the WebSearch topic to search for a solution to a problem.

*Email Notification*

Subscribe in %NOTIFYTOPIC% to get notified by email when the knowledge base gets updated. Support staff should subscribe to be notified, this is a good way to hone trouble shooting skills by having a look at newly submitted problem / solution pairs.
